title: "Personal Wiki"
---

For this project, I set up a personal wiki using Apache and PostgreSQL:

Before I began I needed two things:

-   A Linux Server (I'll be using AWS EC2 service for this)

-   SSH Access to my server

My first step was to head over to my AWS Console and create an EC2 instance (a virtual server.

When the key pair was created, it was downloaded and saved to a location on my machine.

After completing all these screens, I launched my instance.

I clicked "Connect" to connect to my instance using my SSH client. Here are the following steps for connecting using SSH:

-   Open SSH client (I used iterm2)

-   Locate the key-pair I created when I created my instance.

-   Run the **chmod 400** command to ensure that they key is not publicly viewable.

-   Connect my instance using its Public DNS.
