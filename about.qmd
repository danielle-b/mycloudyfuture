Hi! I'm Danielle Brantley!

After years of being a data analyst, I have decided to embark on a transition into cloud engineering. I've been interested in Cloud, DevOps and Infrastructure for some time so I thought I'd go for it! My Cloudy Future is a space where I’ll share my projects, what I’m learning and give you insight into my skills.

In my free time, I’m listening to 90s Hip Hop and R&B, obsessing over podcasts or watching hair and makeup tutorials on YouTube. I’m also trying to keep with the latest trends in media.

Take some time to explore the blog, read something interesting, and feel free to reach out.
