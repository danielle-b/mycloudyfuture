I’ve been interested in Cloud, DevOps and Infrastructure for some time so I thought I’d go for it! My Cloudy Future is a space where I’ll share my projects, what I’m learning and give you insight into my skills.\nIn my free time, I’m listening to 90s Hip Hop and R&B, obsessing over podcasts or watching hair and makeup tutorials on YouTube. I’m also trying to keep with the latest trends in media.\nTake some time to explore the blog, read something interesting, and feel free to reach out."

    "text": "I’m starting my cloud journey with the 30 Day Cloud Challenge created by the Cozy Cloud Crew. Although I do have some experience with cloud services (Big Query Studio, Data Transfers & Looker by Google and S3 by AWS), I thought doing the beginner level of this challenge would be a great opportunity to gain a better understanding of the basics of cloud.\nFor Days 1 and 2, we were first asked to set up a free tier account on a cloud platform. I chose AWS because I already created accounts with them for a course I’m taking to study for the Solutions Architect exam.\nThe second task was to set up a budget. I already have a budget in place but I thought I’d share my process of creating one.\nFirst, from the AWS console, I navigated to the drop-down menu by my account name and selected “Billing and Cost Management”.\n\nAfter selecting “Billing and Cost Management” I was taken to the AWS Billing and Cost Management home page shown below and selected “Budgets” as shown in the red.\n\nI was then taken to the “Budgets” page where I created my budget and chose my budget type. I used a template and selected the “Zero spend budget” option. As you can see here, it also asks me for my email address so I will be notified when the spend threshold has been exceeded.\n\nAfter I created my budget, I was led back to the Budgets page where you can see that I now have a budget.\n\nAnd with that, it’s a wrap for Days 1 & 2 of the challenge! I’m excited and looking forward to the next challenge."
