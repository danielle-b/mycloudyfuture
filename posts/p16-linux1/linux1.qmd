# Chapter 1: Getting Started with the Basics

**Binaries** - files that can be executed

**Linux is case-sensitive**

**Directory-** folder

**Home**-where files created are saved by default

**Kali**-a distribution of Linux specifically designed for penetration testing.

**root** - administrator/superuser account; this account can do nearly everything on the system such as re-configuring the system, adding users and changing passwords.

**script** - series of commands run in an interpretive environment that converts each line into source code.

**shell**- environment and interpreter for running commands in Linux.

**terminal** - command line interface (CLI)

## The Linux Filesystem

**/root** The home directory of the all-powerful root user\

**/etc** Generally contains the Linux configuration files-files that control when and how programs start up\

**/home** The user's home directory\

**/mnt** Where other filesystems are attached or mounted to the filesystem\

**/media** Where CDs and USB devices are usually attached or mounted to the file system\

**/bin** Where application binaries (the equivalent of executables in Microsoft Windows or applications in macOS) reside\

**/lib** Where you'll find libraries(shared programs that are similar to Windows DLLs)

## Navigating the Linux Filesystem

**pwd(print working directory)** - returns your location within the directory structure\

**whoami** - see which user your logged in as\

**cd(change directory)** - change directories from the terminal

-   .. (move up one level)
-   ../.. (move up two levels)
-   / (move up to root level in the file structure)

**ls** - lists both files and subdirectories of a directory\

**ls -l**: get more information about files and directories\

**ls - la**: lists all files including hidden files\

**--help**: provides help with commands\

**man**: provides more information about a comman or application\

**locate**: goes through your entire filesystem and locate every occurence of a keyword (uses a database that is updated once a day)\

**whereis**: used to find location of source/binary file of a command and manuals sections for a specified file in Linux system.\

**which**: only returns the location of the binaries in the PATH variable in Linux.\

**PATH**: holds the directories in which the operating system loks for the commands you execute at the command line.\

**find**: searches for files and directories with various criteria, such as date of creation, owner and size. Only displays exact match names but this is remedied using wildcards.\

**grep**: filter to search for keywords

**piping** : taking an output from one command and sending it as input to another command. We use the \| command to perform piping.

**ps**: displays information about processes running on the machine.

**cat**: displays contents of a file. Also can be used to create new files using the "\>" command along with the name of the file we want to create.
